# Populational size estimation

The size of the population in a country is crucial to epidemiological studies. Despite this,  its estimation in sub-geographical regions and sub-classes is a difficult task. 

The standards census estimations of the population of a country happen every ten years. They measure the total number of people for geographical separations, typically the country, regions, states, municipalities and census areas that are often smaller than typical parishes of the country. The data also contain measures for some typical classes: sex, age-group and ethnic/race groups. 

Â Once inter-census populational size measures are given in $y_{1}$  and $y_{2} = y_{1} + 10$,  estimations of the population size in between this period are done. Estimations after the period $y_{2}$ are extrapolations and usually cause overestimations of epidemiological measures., as relative risks of disease and so on.
