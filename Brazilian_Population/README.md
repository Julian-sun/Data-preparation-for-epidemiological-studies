# Populational size of Brazil

The size of the population in a country is crucial for epidemiological studies. Despite this,  estimations of population size by sub-geographical regions and sub-classes are a difficult task. 

The standards census estimations of the population of a country happen every ten years. They measure the total number of people for geographical separations, typically the country, regions, states, municipalities and census areas that are often smaller than a parish of the country. The data also contain measures for some typical classes: sex, age-group and ethnic/race groups. 

Once inter-census populational size measures are given in year one, $y_{1}$,  and year two, $y_{2} = y_{1} + 10$,  estimations of the population size in between this period are done. Estimations after the period $y_{2}$ are extrapolations and usually cause overestimations of epidemiological measures, as relative risks of disease and so on. 

The folder has the population size of Brasil, which was obtained by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). This work will discuss possible problems in dealing with extrapolations and how we will deal with this data to calculate indices, parameters, and factors that contribute to epidemiological studies.
